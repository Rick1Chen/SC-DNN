### Source code to be uploaded soon! 

## Overview
This repository provides source code and documentation for the implementation of Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing, a novel computing paradigm that provides significantly lower hardware footprint compared to conventional binary computing with high energy efficiency scalability. A software implementation of several computational elements is provided including scaled addition, multiplication, scaled inner product and a stochastic implementation of the hyperbolic function. Furthermore, a stochastic comparator is implemented and used to introduce a stochastic implementation of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). Saturated arithmetic elements are also introduced based on a stochastic linear gain function to confine the downscaling effect due to scaled computational blocks.
