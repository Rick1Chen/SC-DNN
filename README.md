# SC-DNN


## Overview
This repository provides source code and documentation for the implementation of Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing, a novel computing paradigm that provides significantly lower hardware footprint compared to conventional binary computing. A software implementation of several computational elements is provided including scaled addition, multiplication, scaled inner product and a stochastic implementation of the hyperbolic function. Furthermore, a stochastic comparator is implemented and used to introduce a stochastic implementation of the rectified linear unit (ReLU). Saturation arithmetic elements are also introduced based on a stochastic linear gain function.
